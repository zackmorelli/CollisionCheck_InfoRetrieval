# CollisionCheck_InfoRetrieval

This program is for use with ARIA/Eclipse, which is a commerical radiation treatment planning software suite made by Varian Medical Systems which is used in Radiation Oncology. This is one of several programs which I have made while working in the Radiation Oncology department at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. I have licensed it under GPL V3 so it is open-source and publicly available.

There is also a .docx README file in the repo that describes what the program does and how it is organized.

This is a simple command line program that performs queries against the ARIA variansystem database on behalf of the CollisionCheck program.
It is compiled as an .exe file for CollisionCheck to run when needed.
